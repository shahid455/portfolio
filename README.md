## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme).

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Import your repository on Vercel
3. Vercel will detect Next.js and set up the optimal build settings automatically

## Performance Optimization

- All animations are client-side only to prevent hydration errors
- Images use Next.js Image component for optimization
- Fonts are preloaded using Next.js font optimization
